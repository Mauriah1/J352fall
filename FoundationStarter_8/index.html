	<b> COLLEGE PARK, Md. </b> – The proliferation of electric scooters on college campuses was once welcomed as a practical and environmentally friendly mode of transportation. Now the spread of electric scooters across college campuses has alarmed academics, staff, and administrators due to the numerous hazards and hassles these little two-wheeled vehicles pose.

	<br><br>

 E-scooters are becoming a more familiar sight at the University of Maryland, as several companies have set up fleets of electric-powered vehicles throughout the vast campus. 
 <br>
 In 2019, The University of Maryland made a partnership with Veo, they are now accessible all over the campus. Costing $1 to unlock and 25 cents per minute after that.
 <br><br>
 While the initial excitement surrounding their arrival was palpable, the reality of their presence has led to a chorus of complaints from various members of the university community.

 <br>
 Students have voiced concerns about the haphazard parking of e-scooters, which often clutter sidewalks and obstruct entrances to buildings. "It's a daily obstacle course trying to navigate through these things," remarked Camile Dickerson, a junior at the University of Maryland. "They're constantly left in the middle of walkways, creating hazards for pedestrians."
 <br><br>
 In addition to the issue of parking, there have been reports of reckless behavior by e-scooter riders, with some students using the vehicles in prohibited areas or speeding through crowded walkways, posing a danger to themselves and others.
 <br><br>
 "I've seen so many near-misses between scooters and pedestrians," said Rhiley Jones, a graduate student. "It's only a matter of time before someone gets seriously hurt." 
 <br><br>
 “I actually got hit by a sedan van on a Veo scooter, and it has actually changed my whole perspective on riding them”, said Jessica Stanley, a junior at the University of Maryland. 
 <br><br>
 According to the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute (VTTI),on average, 12 injuries occur every 100,000 rides on an e-scooter.

 The City of College Park acknowledged the need to address the growing problems associated with e-scooters. 
<br><br>
 In a city council meeting hosted November 14th, they discussed the partnership with Veo after parking and accessibility issues prompted concern over the presence of VeoRide’s electric scooters and bikes in the city. 
<br><br>
 According to city officials, the city issued Veo 25 parking infractions totaling $875 between October 16 and October 23. This happened as a result of reports of violations involving Veo scooters that weren't at their assigned stations. Some potential solutions being considered include designated parking zones for e-scooters and increased enforcement of rules governing their use on campus.

 The University of Maryland is not alone in facing difficulties related to e-scooters; schools and universities throughout face comparable problems.
<br><br>
 Fordham University is one of the many institutions where e-scooter accidents have raised concerns about safety; they have had a ban on their campuses for e-scooter since January earlier this year.
<br><br>
 In an email sent to the students, Robert Fitzer, associate vice president of Fordham Public Safety, wrote that “the storage and charging of lithium-ion batteries in residence halls and other University buildings represent a serious hazard, as they may explode, causing injuries and starting fires.” 
<br><br>
 Despite the drawbacks, some students still see the value in e-scooters as a convenient transportation option. "When they're used responsibly, e-scooters can be a great way to get around campus quickly," said Sophie Warner, a sophomore at Towson University. "But it's important for everyone to be mindful of others and follow the rules." 
<br><br>
 In response to these growing concerns, universities across the country are exploring a range of potential solutions to address the inconveniences and safety risks associated with e-scooters. 
<br><br>
 “I think if we work together and collaborate there’s lots of creative ideas we can do.” said Joe Bott, VeoRide’s policy and partnerships manager.
