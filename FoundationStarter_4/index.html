<p style="font-family: nunito sans-serif;"> Concerning customer complaints within Student loans, Navient’s claims regarding the Lawsuit have some truths to it. Navient has made a claim that most of its loans come from federal loans, which is true. They stated that there are “53% of student loan balances serviced by Navient for the government (who) are enrolled in income-driven repayment plans — more than any comparable servicer”, said by Navient according to studentloanplanner.com. This is basically saying that because student loaners are repayment plans, they don’t owe them anything. Navient has 21,321 complaints regarding student loans from 12/6/20-12/6/23, most of these complaints have came from the federal student loan servicing program, however there still has been some complaints from the Private student loan programs. </p>

<p style="font-family: nunito sans-serif;"> Navient has had a CFPB lawsuit and a State lawsuits that have taken a toll over the company for the past few years. In 2017 the CFPB accused Navient of failing to act in its customers’ best interests, alongside some other things. However following this lawsuit, attorneys generals worldwide banned together to unite for a big win against Navient. 39 states joined in to to help cancel 1.7 billion in subprime private student loan balances, and pay 95 million in restitution payments to approximately 350,000 student loaners, according to studentloanplanner.com . </p>
